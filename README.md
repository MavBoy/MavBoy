### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maverick

I'm a dedicated security researcher with a deep passion for:
- **Red Teaming** and **Malware Development**
- Constantly enhancing my **coding** and **evasion skills**
- Learning and deploying **new web attacks** and **Active Directory (AD) attack techniques**

As someone who loves the thrill of breaking into challenging machines on **Hack The Box**, I'm always pushing my limits to master the latest AD and security vulnerabilities. You can find my writings on my blog, where I share insights and techniques under my nickname, **Maverick**.
